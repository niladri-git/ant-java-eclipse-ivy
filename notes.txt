Review the updated build.xml script, read comments for self-explanatory.

Main points :

    Manage the project external libraries with Apache Ivy, review the ivy namespace on top, and task “resolve”.
    To compile the source code, you need to declares the classpath. Review task “compile”, and “classpathref” attribute.
    In “jar” task, constructs the entire list of the external libraries and put it into the manifest.mf file.
    In “jar” task, the project jar will be packaged to folder “dist” and the entire external libraries will be copied to from “lib” to “dist/lib”.
